## Big Picture

Through MCDC practicums and DAUs (Data Application for Undergraduates) students and faculty have worked on a wide range of data rich projects for various community partners.

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=FALSE}
## Goal

Take these data projects and package them into open lesson plans for instructors to use at various points in a data science course or curriculum.
:::

. . .

1.  Re-package the data collection, wrangling, and visualization steps from a project into lessons. Providing a beginning students with a sense of how to breakdown and tackle data projects.

2.  Design lessons that attempt the data projects again. 

3.  Create a data repository where instructors and freely access the data and use in examples or their own lessons. Also, submit to existing data repositories. 

. . .

## The Basics

Instructional Materials are being developed and organized by Professors Lizhen Shi and Arend M Kuyper

GitHub Organization `MDCD-Instructional-Materials` will host the developed materials which will all have their own GitHub repositories with all supporting documentation

## Data Projects

[MCDC Data Projects](https://sites.northwestern.edu/mcdc/projects/)

Some of the data is publicly avialable.

Obtaining permission from a few of the projects.

We plan to make use of as many projects as possible!

## Example Lessons

[Lessons for Data Science Pathway Courses](https://sites.northwestern.edu/mcdc/for-faculty/lessons-for-data-science-pathway-courses/) --- Developed by Professor Shi
